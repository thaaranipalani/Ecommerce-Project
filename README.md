REACT&NODE.JS - MINI E-COMMERCE 

FRAMEWORK:Vite+React,Node JS,MongoDb

DESCRIPTION:
a mini e-commerce application built using the MERN stack! 
For the backend, I used Node.js with the Express.js framework, ensuring a robust and scalable server-side implementation. 
To enhance performance and reduce build time, I opted for Vite with React for the frontend, resulting in a faster and more responsive website. 
MongoDB served as the database, providing efficient data storage and retrieval.
I hope you find this project both interesting and useful.
